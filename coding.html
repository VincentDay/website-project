         Coding in Education
      </h1>
    <p>In the late 90’s I participated in several computer programming courses as a part of my Computer Management Information Systems     undergraduate degree—one more forgettable than the next. While these classes were at the core of my studies, those focusing on the     hu  manities were the ones to which I was drawn. Perhaps my right-brain was winning the psychological battle at that time in my lif    e at that time… <br><br>

    On the other hand, Math and Science were the courses that required a particular kind of analytical focus that I had not expected. I    n retrospect, I believe I was beginning to develop the problem solving and critical thinking skills that would serve as a foundatio    n for my future in education. Even as I earned high marks in programming classes, I was struggling in terms of actual learning. The    syntax-laden programming classes had been designed, in tandem with existing pedagogy, for students to duplicate instruction as a me    ans of demonstrating mastery and understanding. The greater the depth of duplication, the higher the earned grade. In my early twen    ties, this was enough for me—get through the courses and keep my GPA up.  Somehow I earned an undergraduate degree in CMIS with a s    trong focus on Computer Science, all without learning much about programming whatsoever. <br>

    Ten years later, I now work for a school where courses in entrepreneurship, digital literacy, and STEM (I prefer STEAM), in partner    ship with classes in the humanities and the arts, have become contributing elements of a rigorous academic program for students of     all abilities, interests, and experiences. Last year I was asked to teach a Gaming class, which has evolved into Game Design and iO    S App Development this year. We have been fortunate enough to work with Dr. Ellen Fishman Johnson and Dr. Youngmoo Kim on ReMix Int    eractive, a collaborative digital media project where my students will develop a light show app with the mentorship of Drexel’s ExC    ITe center. <br><br>
      
    Through the efforts of my students, along with the work I’ve done with SCH Academy’s Center for Entrepreneurial Leadership (CEL), I    ’ve come full circle, as the saying goes; I now believe that skills acquired in Computer Science programs are the same skills that     we need to embrace in education and incorporate into the K-12 student experience. It’s the approach toward that very skill-buildig    that requires change. I was taught specific programming languages, i.e. C, C++, Perl and others, as opposed to actual skills. Exec      utive Director of CEL, Mark Greenberg has stated that…”Every device around us operates thanks to coding. Learning to code provides   insights as to how things work, and more importantly, what is possible. Coding also provides an excellent opportunity to develop CEL   skills including critical thinking, project management, and problem solving to name only a few.” With a different, more practical app  roach toward programming, students will be able to practice those very skills while breaking down large problems into smaller and mor  e solvable parts. <br><br>

  To further support the idea that Computer Science skills are important to our students—Bill Gates, Mark Zuckerburg, Elena Silenok and   other digital leaders talk about programming in education in the following video from code.org What Most Schools Don’t Teach—the vid  eo has received over eleven million views to date.</p>
