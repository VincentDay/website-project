      <p>In honor of his 60th birthday and father’s day—I want to dedicate this piece to my Dad.  Never seeking recognition, he very mu        ch deserves it as he has played a significant role in helping me to become the person that I am…and aspire to be.  I’m set to r        eceive a Master’s of Science in Information Systems (MSIS) from Drexel University this weekend…I have him to thank for helping         me achieve this lifelong goal..</p>
      
      <h2>Pipe Fitter's Son</h2>
      
      <p>Abraham Lincoln High School, at the far end of Northeast Philadelphia, is where I spent grades nine through twelve.  At that t      ime, in the 1990’s, neither I, nor many of my peers, were concerned with our passions when it came to our educations. We were ord      inary guys attending an ordinary big city high school. To the best of their abilities, our teachers taught us the basics of a sta      tic and traditional curriculum. We weren’t encouraged to explore interests that genuinely made us happy. Our role was to earn a h      igh school diploma, perhaps take the SAT’s for college, or study a trade in order to get a good job.</p>
      
      <p>I was raised in a blue-collar neighborhood where adults worked hard for their families because they had no other choices. The       vast majority of them were not passionate about their careers.  My father was a steam fitter for the University of Pennsylvania,       an honorable profession that I admire still to this day. He was up and out of house by 5:30 a.m., not returning home until after       dark.  Despite those long hours at the University, he somehow managed to take my brother and me to baseball practice or down to P      ennypack Creek for a family fishing outing.  At night, he found solace in the sweet melodies of his favorite band—Rush.  While I       never actually heard him play, he had a white guitar in the closet that my mother always smiled over. He is a man who never had t      he chance to live out his rock star dreams.
      
        <i> It seems to me <br><br>

        I could live my life <br><br>

        A lot better than I think I am— <br><br>

        I guess that’s why they call me, <br><br>

        They call me the workin’ man.</i>
